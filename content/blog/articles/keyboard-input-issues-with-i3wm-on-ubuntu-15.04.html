    <p>
        Since the update to 15.04 "Vivid Vervet" I've experienced some new
        input issues: I could not input some characters, most notably those
        requiring a combination of key to press. With a swiss-french layout I
        could not input stuff like <kbd>` ^ ~</kbd> and use my
        configured compose key. The culprit was unknown to me until then:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Input_Bus">IBus</a>.

<p>
    To solve this issue, you can either launch <span class="manpage">im-config(8)</span> <em>as user</em> and select the "none" Input Method or simply do:
```{"linenos":false}
% echo "run_im none" > ~/.xinputrc
```
    Now restart X and enjoy your keyboard back.
