<p>
    I just wanted to link
    <a href="http://insolente0veggie.over-blog.com/article-la-theorie-du-genre-djendeure-120623797.html">
        a cool 5 minutes comic about the "Gender theory" (in french)
    </a>.

<p>
    Now there are more posts tagged with <a href="<%= tag_path 'sex' %>">sex</a>
    than <a href="<%= tag_path 'programming' %>">programming</a>, so I guess I'll
    just go code something.
