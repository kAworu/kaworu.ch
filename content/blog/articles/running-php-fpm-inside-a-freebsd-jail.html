    <p>
        I had an issue while trying to run a php-fpm FastCGI process from a
        FreeBSD jail using <span class="brand">nginx</span> from the host. Like
        many others I experienced the infamous White Screen Of Deathâ„¢  but no
        errors were logged at all (even with the full debug config all set from
        both <span class="filename">php-fpm.conf</span> and
        <span class="filename">php.ini</span>).
</div>

```{"title":"nginx.conf","language":"nginx"}
# ...
upstream princesse-bulldozer-php-fpm {
    server [2a01:4f8:120:5388:0:b:249:1]:9000;
} server {
    listen   *:80;
    listen   [::]:80;
    # ...
    root /usr/jails/jail0.kaworu.ch/home/princesse-bulldozer.ch/wordpress;
    index index.php;
    # Pass all .php files onto a php-fpm/php-fcgi server.
    location ~ [^/]\.php(/|$) {
        fastcgi_index index.php;

        fastcgi_pass princesse-bulldozer-php-fpm;
        # fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /home/princesse-bulldozer.ch/wordpress$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

<p>
    As <span class="brand">nginx</span> is run from the host, using the "full"
    path as <code>root</code> (line 8) is correct. But since php-fpm is jailed,
    the <code>SCRIPT_FILENAME</code> path should not use
    <code>$document_root</code> (see line 15 which does not work). It has to be
    set to the "jailed" path (line 16). Hope it can avoid a couple of painful
    debugging out there :)
