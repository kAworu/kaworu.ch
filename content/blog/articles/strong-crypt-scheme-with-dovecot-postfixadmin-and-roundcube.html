        Hi everyone, happy new year :)
    </p>
    <p>
        While
        <a href="http://www.dovecot.org/"><span class="brand">Dovecot</span></a>
        support a <em>lot</em> of different password schemes, making both
        <a href="http://postfixadmin.sourceforge.net/"><span class="brand">Postfixadmin</span></a>
        and
        <a href="https://roundcube.net/"><span class="brand">Roundcube</span></a>
        playing nice by using something else than the old MD5 scheme need a
        little work.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this post I'll explain how to configure them to use a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(C)#Blowfish-based_scheme">Blowfish scheme</a>
        (<strong>BLF-CRYPT</strong> in the <span class="brand">Dovecot</span> terminology),
        but you can easily adapt the steps to use something else. You should already have
        <span class="brand">Dovecot</span>, <span class="brand">Postfixadmin</span>, and
        <span class="brand">Roundcube</span> (with the password plugin) up and running.

<h2>First of all</h2>
<p>
    Let me state the obvious: backup your configuration files, database,
    etc. before any changes.
</p>

<h2>Checking BLF-CRYPT support</h2>
<p>
    We need to check if the system support
    <strong>BLF-CRYPT</strong>. As stated in
    <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Tools/Doveadm/Pw">the documentation</a>:
    <strong>BLF-CRYPT</strong>, <strong>SHA256-CRYPT</strong>, and
    <strong>SHA512-CRYPT</strong> are optional and their availability depends
    on the system's libc.
</p>
```{"linenos":false}
% doveadm pw -s BLF-CRYPT -p test
```
<p>
    If you get something like:
</p>
```{"linenos":false}
Fatal: Unknown scheme: BLF-CRYPT
```
<p>
    Then <strong>BLF-CRYPT</strong> is not available on your system. You can
    run <kbd>doveadm pw -l</kbd> to see the list of supported scheme, and pick
    the best one available. If you don't know how to choose,
    <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Authentication/PasswordSchemes#What_scheme_to_use.3F">the <span class="brand">Dovecot</span> documentation</a>
    is a good start.
</p>

<h2>Computing the ideal number of round</h2>
<p>
    The shorter the number of rounds, the faster a password hash is computed;
    the faster a password hash is computed, the faster is an attack trying many
    passwords (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack">Brute-force attack</a>).
    On the other hand, a high number rounds means it is harder to brute-force
    but also harder to compute for legitimate use (in this case users
    connecting to their emails). For a good read on the question check
    <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3959/recommended-of-iterations-when-using-pkbdf2-sha256/3993#3993">Thomas Pornin's answer on stackexchange</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In this example we'll pick the least number of rounds taking more than
    250ms to compute a password hash (try different values for <code>-r</code>
    until happy):
</p>
```{"linenos":false}
% /usr/bin/time doveadm pw -s BLF-CRYPT -r 12 -p test
{BLF-CRYPT}$2a$12$Y7ai9J06MhusOmJ0r/0nB.Aok4gts53SCDx/pZLN0FwjS09BBRWPa
        0.30 real         0.30 user         0.00 sys
```
<p class="codeblock-comment text-warning">
    <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></i>
    Be sure to run this command on the same machine that will run the
    <span class="brand">Dovecot</span> server, the whole point is to find a
    minimum computation time when user actually login on the "production"
    server.
</p>

<h2><span class="brand">Postfixadmin</span> configuration</h2>
<p>
    Here is the relevant configuration part:
</p>
```{"title":"config.local.php","language":"PHP"}
// Encrypt
// In what way do you want the passwords to be crypted?
// md5crypt = internal postfix admin md5
// md5 = md5 sum of the password
// system = whatever you have set as your PHP system default
// cleartext = clear text passwords (ouch!)
// mysql_encrypt = useful for PAM integration
// authlib = support for courier-authlib style passwords
// dovecot:CRYPT-METHOD = use dovecotpw -s 'CRYPT-METHOD'. Example: dovecot:CRAM-MD5
//   (WARNING: don't use dovecot:* methods that include the username in the
//   hash - you won't be able to login to PostfixAdmin in this case)
$CONF['encrypt'] = 'dovecot:BLF-CRYPT';

// If you use the dovecot encryption method: where is the dovecotpw binary located?
// for dovecot 1.x
// $CONF['dovecotpw'] = "/usr/sbin/dovecotpw";
// for dovecot 2.x (dovecot 2.0.0 - 2.0.7 is not supported!)
// $CONF['dovecotpw'] = "/usr/sbin/doveadm pw";
$CONF['dovecotpw'] = "/usr/local/bin/doveadm pw -r 12";
```

        <li value="19">
            Don't forget to adapt the <code>-r</code> option value to the
            number of rounds found in the last step. Also check your doveadm
            executable path
            (<span class="filename">/usr/local/bin/doveadm</span> in this
            example).
        </li>
    </ol>

<h2>Old password scheme backward compatibility</h2>
<p>
    Now in order to allow admin account to still login using the "old" password
    scheme (which is still the one used in your database at this point!), you
    need to figure out which one it is. First look at one of the password from
    the postfix database:
</p>
```{"language":"SQL","linenos":false}
SELECT password FROM admin LIMIT 1;
```

<p>
    Then check the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(C)#Key_Derivation_Functions_Supported_by_crypt">Key derivation Functions table</a>
    to find the corresponding scheme. For example, if your password look like
    <code>$1$etNnh7FA$OlM7eljE/B7F1J4XYNnk81</code> then it is using the MD5
    scheme.
</p>

<p>
    Once you know the old passwords scheme you need to find how
    <span class="brand">Dovecot</span> prefix it. The prefix should be easy to
    guess knowing the scheme name (for MD5 it is <strong>MD5-CRYPT</strong>),
    you can check by running
    <kbd>doveadm pw -s CRYPT-NAME-TO-TEST -p test</kbd>
    and see if the result looks like the corresponding Wikipedia's example.
    Again, the full list of scheme supported by
    <span class="brand">Dovecot</span> <kbd>doveadm pw -l</kbd> may be helpful.
</p>

<p>
    Alright! Now we can prefix all the old password so they can still be used
    to log in:
</p>
```{"language":"SQL","linenos":false}
UPDATE admin   SET password = CONCAT('{MD5-CRYPT}', password);
UPDATE mailbox SET password = CONCAT('{MD5-CRYPT}', password);
```

<h2><span class="brand">Postfixadmin</span> checkup</h2>
<p>
    Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of steps to check that the new
    configuration work as expected:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Login using a <span class="brand">Postfixadmin</span> admin account,
            it should work and still use the "old" password scheme.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Once logged in, change your password. Once updated, check that your
            new password has been hashed using the new password scheme:
        </p>
```{"language":"SQL","linenos":false}
SELECT password FROM admin ORDER BY modified DESC LIMIT 1;
```
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Logout and login again, it should work now using the new password
            scheme.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Create a new mailbox and check that its password has been hashed
            using the new password scheme:
        </p>
```{"language":"SQL","linenos":false}
SELECT password FROM mailbox ORDER BY modified DESC LIMIT 1;
```
    </li>
</ol>

<h2><span class="brand">Roundcube</span> password plugin configuration</h2>
<p>
    Here is the relevant configuration part:
</p>
```{"title":"plugins/password/config.inc.php","language":"PHP"}
// The SQL query used to change the password.
// The query can contain the following macros that will be expanded as follows:
//      %p is replaced with the plaintext new password
//      %c is replaced with the crypt version of the new password, MD5 if available
//         otherwise DES.
//      %D is replaced with the dovecotpw-crypted version of the new password
//      %o is replaced with the password before the change
//      %n is replaced with the hashed version of the new password
//      %q is replaced with the hashed password before the change
//      %h is replaced with the imap host (from the session info)
//      %u is replaced with the username (from the session info)
//      %l is replaced with the local part of the username
//         (in case the username is an email address)
//      %d is replaced with the domain part of the username
//         (in case the username is an email address)
// Escaping of macros is handled by this module.
// Default: "SELECT update_passwd(%c, %u)"
$rcmail_config['password_query'] = "UPDATE mailbox SET password = %D, modified = NOW() WHERE username = %u";

// By default domains in variables are using unicode.
// Enable this option to use punycoded names
$rcmail_config['password_idn_ascii'] = false;

// Path for dovecotpw (if not in $PATH)
$rcmail_config['password_dovecotpw'] = '/usr/local/bin/doveadm pw -r 12';

// Dovecot method (dovecotpw -s 'method')
$rcmail_config['password_dovecotpw_method'] = 'BLF-CRYPT';

// Enables use of password with crypt method prefix in %D, e.g. {MD5}$1$LUiMYWqx$fEkg/ggr/L6Mb2X7be4i1/
$rcmail_config['password_dovecotpw_with_method'] = true;
```

            YMMV regarding the <code>password_query</code> but the important
            part is to use <code>%D</code> as it is the dovecotpw-crypted

<h2><span class="brand">Roundcube</span> checkup</h2>
<p>
    Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of steps to check that the new
    configuration work as expected:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Login from <span class="brand">Roundcube</span> with your usual
            access. It should work and still use the "old" password scheme.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Once logged in, change your password. Once updated, check that your
            new password has been hashed using the new password scheme:
        </p>
```{"language":"SQL","linenos":false}

            scheme.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>The End.</h2>
<p>
    That's it! Now all you need is to convince (or force) mailbox
    and admin users to reset their password so they use the new scheme, which may
    well be the hardest part.
