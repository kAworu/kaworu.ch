        Not too long ago (back in 2008) I wrote
        <a href="https://github.com/kAworu/tagutil">tagutil</a>, a small CLI
        tool to display and edit music files tags. At the time I felt in need
        of something easy script without GUI, but most of all I wanted a tool
        with a complete support for <em>Vorbis Comment</em>.
  <p>
        While both <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">Ogg/Vorbis</a> and
        <a href="https://xiph.org/flac/">FLAC</a> uses Vorbis Comment,
        <em>libFLAC</em> has the courtesy to provide a simple API to read and
        write them, where <em>libogg</em>/<em>libvorbis</em> only provide a way
        to read them. OK, It's not entierly true; it is possible to write them,
        it's just <em>damn hard</em> compared to libFLAC because you need
        <em>a good understanding of Ogg/Vorbis's design</em>.

<h2>Theory time!</h2>

<p>
    In order to modify Vorbis Comment you need to understand a bit about
    Ogg/Vorbis. In a Ogg/Vorbis stream, Ogg is the <em>container format</em>
    and Vorbis is the <em>audio codec format</em>. So far so good.

<h3>Ogg</h3>

<p>
    An Ogg <em>stream</em> is divided into <em>pages</em> containing
    <em>packets</em>.  Each page contains up to 255 <em>segments</em>, and a
    packet can be formed by any number of segments. Without going too deep,
    what you need to understand is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A <em>packet</em>, which is a
        <q>meaningful unit of data for the decoder</q>, is contained into one
        or more pages.
    <li>
        A <em>page</em> can contains many packets, or one unique packet, or
        only parts of a packet (that is several segments of said packet but not
        all of them).
</ul>

<p>
    If you want to know more, you'll find plenty of documentation on the web
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg">The Ogg page on Wikipedia</a>
    is a good start).

<h3>Vorbis</h3>

<p>
    A Vorbis stream is logically divided into packets and the
    <em>three first packet are the header packets</em>. More importantly for
    us, the <em>Vorbis Comment header is the second packet</em>. Thus, the
    general algorithm to replace Vorbis Comment is, as described in the
    "Metadata workflow" of
    <a href="https://xiph.org/vorbis/doc/libvorbis/overview.html">libvorbis documentation</a>:
</p>

<ol>
    <li> copy the first packet
    <li> insert a packet with your own Vorbis Comment
    <li>copy the third and all following packets.
</ol>

<h2>There's always a trick <small class="text-muted">that's where the pain comes in</small></h2>

<p>
    For each audio packet, we need to compute the <em>granulepos</em>. The
    granulepos is an codec specific value, allowing seeking through the stream.
    In Vorbis the granulepos is based on the number of sample elapsed. The
    sample count for a packet can be computed using the
    <a href="https://xiph.org/vorbis/doc/libvorbis/vorbis_packet_blocksize.html">
        <code>vorbis_packet_blocksize()</code>
    </a> routine.

    <a href="http://lists.xiph.org/pipermail/vorbis-dev/2003-November/007936.html">
        An interesting discussion
    </a> on the vorbis-dev mailling about granulepos explains why we need to
    compute it for each packet and hint that
    <code>vorbis_packet_blocksize()</code> is poorly named and actually compute
    the number of samples that a packet would hold.

<p>
    It is important to note that although the granulepos value is only
    meaningful for the codec, it is stored at the <em>Ogg page layer</em>.

<p class="text-muted">
    More about the granulepos:

</ul>

<h2>C examples</h2>

<p>
    Most examples are tools to repair the <em>granulepos</em>. Although not
    obvious at first, they are very close to do what we need. The only
    difference is that we want to replace the second header packet. Since the
    <em>granulepos</em> has to be computed only for audio packets, there is no
    need to compute it for the header packets.

<h3>vorbiscomment</h3>

<p>
    The reference example is
    <a href="https://svn.xiph.org/trunk/vorbis-tools/vorbiscomment/">vorbiscomment</a>
    from vorbis-tools. Unlike the other examples, this program is able to alter
    Vorbis Comment. Although it does what we want, two problems prevented me to
    make good use of it:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>It's licensed under the GPLv2 (and my project is under a 2-clause BSD).
    <li>It's not as easy to read as you would like an example to be.
</ol>

<p>
    The magic happens in the <code>vcedit_write()</code> routine from
    <a href="<%= static_url '/code/ogg/vcedit.c' %>">vcedit.c</a>.

<h3>revorb.cpp <small class="text-muted">it's actually C</small></h3>

<p>
    <a href="<%= static_url '/code/ogg/revorb.cpp' %>">This program</a> wrote by
    Jiri Hruska is a granuelpos fixer. The header packets processing
    is easy to read and is the purpose of the <code>copy_headers()</code>
    routine. The granulepos computation use the same formula as in vcedit.

<h3>oggfix_granulepos.c</h3>

<p>
    Gunter Königsmann wrote a small program to
    <q>
        recalculates the granulepos of a complete Ogg/Vorbis stream without altering the rest of it
    </q>.  He kindly
    <a href="http://lists.xiph.org/pipermail/vorbis-dev/2010-November/020173.html">
        sent it to the vorbis-dev mailling list
    </a> (I also host a copy
    <a href="<%= static_url '/code/ogg/oggfix_granulepos.c' %>">here</a>). It is very
    well commented and its granulepos computation is unlike every other
    examples: it actually decode the Vorbis stream to get the samples count "by
    hand" rather than using <code>vorbis_packet_blocksize()</code>.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    There is a lot of work and understanding to get the job done. Ideally there
    should be simple ways of doing simple tasks. I hope that this post will
    help anyone trying to modify Vorbis Comment !

<p>
    The <kbd>#vorbis</kbd> IRC channel on freenode was kind, reactive and
    precise. Looking back I should have get there sooner. Kudos to them !

<p>
    Finally, here is my program to write Vorbis Comment. Note that in this
    example you cannot use the ogg "source" file as the destination file, you
    can find another of my example creating a temporary file and using
    <span class="manpage">rename(2)</span>
    <a href="https://github.com/kAworu/tagutil/blob/master/src/t_ftoggvorbis.c">here</a>
    (but it's using non-standard stuff).
