    As you might have noticed, the view has changed a bit here :)

<p>
    I am using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> daily
    at work and being able to use all its goodies while blogging was haunting
    me. So I wrote a Bootstrap based theme for Octopress: <em>Octostrap3</em>

<p>
    I also started a <a href="http://kaworu.github.io/octopress/">demo blog</a>
    to provide an handy installation and configuration guide (I'll also post my
    Octopress tricks there). If you feel forky, go straight to the
    <a href="https://github.com/kAworu/octostrap3">GitHub repository</a>
