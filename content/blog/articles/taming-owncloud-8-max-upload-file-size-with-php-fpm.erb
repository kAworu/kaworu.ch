        After updating ownCloud to 8, the max file upload suddenly ignored my
        customizations efforts that were working flawlessly with ownCloud 7.
        Instead of the configured 4G, ownCloud would cap the max file upload size
        to 513M (a very odd looking number for the geeky eye). A quick
        <code>phpinfo()</code> revealed that both
        <code>upload_max_filesize</code> and <code>post_max_size</code> were
        locally set to 513M. To the best of my knowledge, the only way to
        locally override theses options was by using a
        <span class="filename">.htaccess</span> file but since my setup does
        not use Apache + mod_php but nginx + php-fpm instead (and thus should
        ignore <span class="filename">.htaccess</span>), I was rather confused.

<h2>there comes .user.ini</h2>

<p>
    Well, since PHP 5.3.0 there is a file that get to override php.ini stuff:
    <a href="https://php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.per-user.php">the .user.ini files</a>.
    So, there are two solutions:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        remove ownCloud's <span class="filename">.user.ini</span> file and live
        in the fear of any update (re)installing it.
    <li>
        disable those evil <span class="filename">.user.ini</span> files from
        <span class="filename">php.ini</span>:
</ol>

```{"language":"dosini","title":"php.ini","linenos":false}
