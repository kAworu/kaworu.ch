        I am using <a href="https://rspamd.com/">Rspamd</a> since a while now and I
        happy with it. In a nutshell <span class="brand">Rspamd</span> is a
        fast, free and extensible spam filtering system.

    <p>
        <del>
            To be honest I am not a guru when it comes to mail server
            configuration.  Every time I'm hacking something in the mail
            territory I have to look up what is a MTA, MDA etc.
        </del>
        Well, now I think I am kinda good at understanding emails.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike spamassasin,
        <span class="brand">Rspamd</span> was simple to setup and has sane
        defaults so I adopted it merrily. As a bonus, it has a sexy Web UI.

    <p>
        In this post I'll provide my configuration for a nice integration with
        the <a href="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Plugins/Antispam"><span class="brand">Dovecot</span> antispam plugin</a>.

<h2>Figuring out your dovecot antispam plugin version</h2>
<p>
    There are two versions of the <span class="brand">Dovecot</span> antispam
    plugin:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="https://johannes.sipsolutions.net/Projects/dovecot-antispam">the <strong>original</strong> one written by Johannes Berg</a>;
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://hg.dovecot.org/dovecot-antispam-plugin">a <strong>fork</strong> by Eugene Paskevich</a>.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The configuration differ slightly between the two, so you need to find
    out which one you have installed
    (for info <span class="brand">Debian</span>
    <a href="https://packages.debian.org/jessie/dovecot-antispam">package the <strong>original</strong></a>,
    while <span class="brand">FreeBSD</span>
    <a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/mail/dovecot2-antispam-plugin/">package the <strong>fork</strong></a>).
</p>
<p>
    run <kbd>man dovecot-antispam</kbd> and check the end of the man page. If
    it contains something like:
</p>
<pre>
    <strong>THIS FORK AUTHOR AND MAINTAINER</strong>
        o  Eugene Paskevich &lt;eugene@raptor.kiev.ua&gt;.
</pre>
<p>
    Then you have the <strong>fork</strong> version, otherwise it is the <strong>original</strong>.
</p>

<h2><span class="brand">Dovecot</span> configuration</h2>
<p>
    Add the <strong>antispam</strong> mail plugin to the relevant part of the
    imap configuration:
</p>
```{"title":"conf.d/20-imap.conf"}
protocol imap {
  # ...
  # Space separated list of plugins to load (default is global mail_plugins).
  #mail_plugins = $mail_plugins
  mail_plugins = $mail_plugins antispam
  # ...
}
```
<p>
    Then configure the plugin (pick your matching version):
</p>
<div class="clearfix">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
```{"title":"conf.d/90-plugin.conf (original version)"}
plugin {
    antispam_backend = pipe
    antispam_spam    = Junk
    antispam_trash   = Trash
    antispam_mail_sendmail = /usr/local/bin/rspamc
    antispam_mail_spam     = learn_spam
    antispam_mail_notspam  = learn_ham
    antispam_mail_sendmail_args = -h;localhost:11334;-P;q1
}
```
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
```{"title":"conf.d/90-plugin.conf (fork version)"}
plugin {
    antispam_backend = mailtrain
    antispam_spam    = Junk
    antispam_trash   = Trash
    antispam_mail_sendmail = /usr/local/bin/rspamc
    antispam_mail_spam     = learn_spam
    antispam_mail_notspam  = learn_ham
    antispam_mail_sendmail_args = -h;localhost:11334;-P;q1
}
```
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="codeblock-comment alert alert-info">
    <ol>
        <li value="2">
            This is the part that differ between the <strong>original</strong>
            (pipe) and <strong>fork</strong> (mailtrain) version.
        </li>
        <li value="5">
            YMMV, adapt the <span class="manpage">rspamc(1)</span> executable
            path (<span class="filename">/usr/local/bin/rspamc</span> in this
            example).
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>What this configuration does is: </p>

<ul>
    <li>
        When a mail is moved from any IMAP directory (except <code>Trash</code>
        and <code>Junk</code>) to the <code>Junk</code> directory, the
        following command will be issued:
```{"linenos":false}
% /usr/local/bin/rspamc -h localhost:11334 -P q1 learn_spam < mail
```
    <li>
        When a mail is moved from the <code>Junk</code> directory to any IMAP
        directory (except <code>Trash</code> and <code>Junk</code>) the
        following command will be issued:
```{"linenos":false}
% /usr/local/bin/rspamc -h localhost:11334 -P q1 learn_ham < mail
```
</ul>

<p>
    So every time a user gets a spam into its <code>Inbox</code>, moving it
    into <code>Junk</code> will make <span class="brand">Rspamd</span> learn it
    as spam (and hopefully filter it better the next time).  Every time someone
    gets a desired email into <code>Junk</code>, moving it into its
    <code>Inbox</code> (or else) will make <span class="brand">Rspamd</span>
    learn it as ham.

<p>
    This is not perfect for all needs though. As you can see I use a
    system-wide spam/ham database, so choices from one user does effectively
    affect how <span class="brand">Rspamd</span> filter mail for every users.


<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
    Be sure to adapt the <span class="brand">Rspamd</span> password to the one
    you've choosen while configuring <span class="brand">Rspamd</span>. I've
    left the default password <code>q1</code> in this
    example.
<p>
    Be extra careful if you need to tweak
    <code>antispam_mail_sendmail_args</code>: it uses </code>;</code>
    as separator for arguments. I remember having a lot of troubles while
    debugging because of that.
