        I hate <span class="brand">PHP</span>.<br>
        Seriously, people design mugs, T-shirts, write
        <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~frew/Plack-Middleware-Acme-PHPE9568F34-D428-11d2-A769-00AA001ACF42/lib/Plack/Middleware/Acme/PHPE9568F34/D428/11d2/A769/00AA001ACF42.pm">parody code</a> and
        <a href="http://phpsadness.com">full websites</a> about how
        <em>bad</em> it is.

    <p>
        Although I don't think that the whole internet could sum up all the
        insanity it contains, I am not planning a long complaining post
        (although the temptation is em), but <em>I had to do something</em>.

    Some fellow bloggers already did a great hating job (thanks to them!). The
    best posts I could read on the topic are
    <a href="http://www.steike.com/code/php-must-die/">PHP Must Die</a> and
    <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">
        PHP: a fractal of bad design
    </a>. The first one is short and simple while the second is exhaustive and
    merciless (there is a link to the PHP documentation in its "Credits"
    section).

<p>
    <a href="http://software-gunslinger.tumblr.com/post/47131406821/php-is-meant-to-die">
        PHP is meant to die
    </a> is also a very interesting post I recently found.  It is focused on
    the "dying programming model of PHP" and its consequences.

<p>
    Still, it's when you dig into code that you realize
    <a href="http://use.perl.org/use.perl.org/_Aristotle/journal/33448.html">
        how deep the rabbit whole is
    </a>. When I feel sad and bad at writing programs, I just
    <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">linger there for a while</a> and
    soon, I would smile again.

    Last time I checked, they were using <code>-INT_MAX</code>.
