<p>
    Writing and reading programs is my job and a passion. Learning new
    programming languages has become an addiction to me.  I'm doing my best to
    to stay hungry and foolish.

<p>
    Today, I'm using mostly PHP and Node.js at work. On my spare time, I like
    working with <em>Ruby</em> and <em>C</em>. <span class="brand">ViM</span>
    and <span class="brand">UNIX</span> have become my favourite tools.

<p>
    On day, I started university and the computers there were using Red Hat. I
    liked the command line tutorial we had to do as exercices and decided to
    install <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">gentoo linux</a> at home. I was
    amazed - and still am - when I discovered how the Open Source community is
    sharing code, documentation, knowledge, and help. Not long after I decided
    to rent a small dedicated server, and started to learn system
    administration along with programming.

<p>
    Learning computer science is somehow unique. While just as for other skills
    you need a good balance between theory and practice, you can learn both all
    by yourself with virtually no cost but time, good documentation and an old
    computer.

<h2>Cool Projects</h2>

<p>
    Here I would like to list some project that, in my opinion, need more
    visibility. They bring the fun I have with computers.

<div class="panel panel-primary">
    <div class="panel-heading">i3</div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
            <em>i3</em> is a minimalist tiling windows manager. I know, that sounds
            familiar (there are so many of them). The reason why i3 stands out for me is
            because it is <em>elegant</em>: simple to configure yet very powerful.
            If, like me, VIM-like mode in your windows manager sounds like christmas , give
            it a try!

<h2>Cool Books</h2>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    This part is still a work in progress. I will keep a list of books I've
    read with some personal comments.
